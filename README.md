time-lapse-server
=================

Node timelapse server. The idea is to use this as a platform for IP camera, time lapse and computer vision in general. The structure will be modular.

At the moment I am experiencing issues with the servo control 

Install:
1. git https://github.com/pfnegrini/time-lapse-server.git
2. cd time-lapse-server
3. sudo bash TLinstall.sh
